In the context I provided, "root" was referring to the top-level folder in the current directory path. However, if by "root" you mean the **root of the current open repository** in your VS Code workspace, then we need to adjust the prompt function to dynamically detect the repository root, rather than just the top-level folder.

To do this, we can use Git commands to identify the root of the current Git repository and adjust the prompt function accordingly. Here’s how you can modify the prompt function to achieve that:

### Steps to Set Up the Prompt Function with Repository Root

1. **Open Your PowerShell Profile**:
   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

2. **Add the Custom `prompt` Function for Git Repository Root**:
   - Use this modified `prompt` function to display the **drive + repository root (+ current directory if not at the root)**:

     ```powershell
     function prompt {
         $path = (Get-Location).Path
         $drive = Split-Path -Path $path -Qualifier  # Get the drive (e.g., C:\)

         # Try to get the Git repository root
         $gitRoot = (git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>$null)
         
         if ($gitRoot) {
             # If we're in a Git repo, use the repo root
             $repoRoot = Split-Path -Path $gitRoot -Leaf  # Get the name of the repo root folder
             $current = Split-Path -Path $path -Leaf       # Get the current directory
             
             if ($current -eq $repoRoot) {
                 "$drive$repoRoot> "  # Show only drive + repo root
             } else {
                 "$drive$repoRoot\$current> "  # Show drive + repo root + current if not at root
             }
         } else {
             # If not in a Git repo, fall back to showing drive + top-level folder
             $root = (Split-Path -Path $path -NoQualifier -Parent)
             $current = Split-Path -Path $path -Leaf

             if ($current -eq $root) {
                 "$drive$root> "
             } else {
                 "$drive$root\$current> "
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - The function attempts to get the Git repository root using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, which returns the absolute path of the repository root if you’re inside a Git repo.
     - If in a Git repository, it displays the **drive + repository root** (and the current directory if not at the root).
     - If not in a Git repo, it defaults to the drive + top-level folder as before.

3. **Save and Reload**:
   - Save the profile file and reload it:
     ```powershell
     . $PROFILE
     ```

### Note
- This solution assumes you have Git installed and accessible in your PowerShell environment.
- If you’re not in a Git repository, it will simply display the drive + top-level folder.

With this setup, your prompt will adapt based on whether you’re inside a Git repository, showing the repository root when applicable. This keeps your prompt contextually relevant while remaining concise.
